## Wikis / Documentation

- :blue_book: [Wiki](https://ityreh.github.io/) - This is my personal Wiki where I write down some technical setups and hints. It's one of my electronic memories. Changes are deployed from my [documentation source repository](https://github.com/ityreh/mkdocs) to the [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/ityreh/ityreh.github.io) via [GitHub Actions Job](https://github.com/ityreh/mkdocs/blob/main/.github/workflows/make.yml).
- :mortar_board: [Kinzig Academy]() - A collection of mindmaps and code snippets as a chaotic result of my research.

## System / Development Environment

- :computer: [ArchInstall](https://github.com/ityreh/arch-install) - Installer for my personal Arch Linux development environment.
- :gear: [Dotfiles](https://github.com/ityreh/.dotfiles) - Dotfiles for my personal Arch Linux development environment configuration.
